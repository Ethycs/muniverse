# Downloading games

The [download](download) script downloads and prepares every game. It depends on `jq` and `curl`, which can be installed on Linux like so:

```
sudo apt-get install jq curl
```

or on macOS like so:

```
brew install jq
```

You should run the download script from inside this directory, like:

```
./download
```

The download script creates a directory called `downloaded_games` and makes a sub-directory for each game it downloads. Each game sub-directory contains an `index.html` file and various game-specific resource files. Each subdirectory also contains an `info.json` file with specific information about that game.

To download only a specific game, you can specify the game name as an argument, like in:

```
./download Babel-v0
```

# The `spec.json` file

The [spec.json](spec.json) file contains a JSON array of game objects. Each game object contains various information about a game. There are two general types of game objects: base objects and variant objects. A base object defines lots of information about a game, such URLs for downloading game assets. A variant object references a base object and applies some slight modifications to it. Here's what a base object might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "SomeGame-v0",
  "base": "http://someurl",
  "top_injections": [
    "faketime.js"
  ],
  "bottom_injections": [
    "SomeGame-v0.js"
  ],
  "resources": [
    "js/game.js",
    "js/jquery-2.0.3.min.js",
    "sounds/explosion.ogg",
    "css/reset.css",
  ],
  "processors": [
    "some_script"
  ],
  "metadata": {},
  "width": 320,
  "height": 480,
  "key_whitelist": ["KeyLeft", "KeyRight"]
}
```

The fields in a base object have the following meaning:

 * **name:** a CamelCase name with a version number after it.
 * **base:** the base URL to fetch as `index.html`. Also the URL to which resource paths are relative.
 * **top_injections:** scripts from the [injections](injections) directory to inject into the top of `<head>`.
 * **bottom_injections:** like *top_injections*, but for the bottom of `<head>`.
 * **resources:** a list of paths to download. All paths are relative to *base*. This list should be exhaustive; it should cover every resource consumed by the game.
 * **processors:** scripts from [process](process) to run on the downloaded game. More on this in [The download process](#the-download-process).
 * **metadata:** game-specific meta-data. This may be used to provide information to processor scripts.
 * **width:** desired browser viewport width.
 * **height:** desired browser viewport height.
 * **all_canvas:** (optional) boolean indicating if the game consists of a single full-screen canvas. You should only set this to `true` if the DOM contains one `<canvas>` which fills up the entire page. If this is `true`, observations may be taken directly from the canvas.
 * **key_whitelist:** a list of allowed key codes.
 * **options:** (optional) object to be passed as an argument to `window.muniverse.init()`. If absent, `{}` is used as a default.

Variant objects define games which are derived from other games. Here's what a variant object might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "SomeGame-v1",
  "variant_of": "SomeGame-v0",
  "options": {
    "level": 3,
    "color": "brown"
  },
  "width": 480
}
```

A variant object's **variant_of** field indicates the base object from which the variant is derived. In addition to the **variant_of** field, a variant object may define its own **width**, **height**, **key_whitelist**, and **options**. If one of those fields is not defined, it is inherited from the base object.

# The download process

When a game is downloaded, three basic steps are taken:

 * A game directory is made and the resources are downloaded, including `index.html`.
 * Each script in the game's `processors` array is run with the game directory as an argument.
 * The `index.html` file is modified to include the injected scripts from `top_injections` and `bottom_injections`.

A processor script can find out information about a game by looking at the game's `info.json` file. The `info.json` file is located in the root of the game directory and contains a copy of the game object from `spec.json`.

All base objects in the `spec.json` file specify how to download a game. Variant objects, on the other hand, do not specify how to download or prepare a game. Rather, variants use the downloaded directory of their base games.

# Adding a game

The first thing to do is figure out what resources the game uses. Try to build a complete list of the files loaded by the game. This way, you can build up the `resources` array.

Every game must expose a `window.muniverse` object with three functions, all of which return Promises. These functions are:

 * **init(options):** get the game to a logical starting point, where an agent can immediately start making actions. The game should be paused in some way so that *step* needn't be called immediately after *init*. The options argument is the same as the `options` object in the game spec.
 * **score:** get the current (numerical) score.
 * **step(millis):** advance the game by the given number of milliseconds. Return a boolean which is `true` if the game has ended.

In order to provide the above API, you will likely want to do a few things:

 * Inject the [injections/faketime.js](injections/faketime.js) API in order to control time.
 * Inject your own script to hijack the game and implement the `window.muniverse` API.
 * Write a processor script to make the code easier to handle.
   * Remove unwanted content like ads or analytics.
   * Patch JS code to manipulate it more easily.
